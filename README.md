Hi, I’m @LBargie

I'm currently a Data Engineer at LumiraDx. 

I was previously a senior laboratory scientist before making the jump to a data-centred role.

My day job is to largely code in Python but I started my data science journey by teaching myself how to use R for data analysis and I still like to code in R when I get the chance.

I'm going to use GitHub to share code for any personal data projects that I work on.

You can also find me on Twitter @L_Bargie
